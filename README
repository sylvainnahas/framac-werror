* About *

framac-werror is a plugin for the C source-code analysis Frama-C platform (www.frama-c.com). It changes the behaviour of this tool so that it returns a non-nul error code to the OS if there are proof obligations that could not be validated. 

This plugin is intended to be used in automated settings like Makefiles, when users want confidence they can not overlook a validation error. Build processes may be very verbose and by default Frama-C returns an error code of 0 even if the code to be analysed contains run-time errors. The risk that a developer ignores a warning is real. Since the point of using tools like Frama-C is to garanty the abscence of errors altogether, a stricter behavior than the default may be sensible.

When analysing incomplete applications (in Frama-C's talk) some proof obligations may have a "unknown" state, that is while analysing the code the tool does not have enough information to decide if these constraints are valid or invalid. The plugin offers command-line arguments that tell the plugin to not consider these proofs as erroneous. This is useful when checking libraries for example. 

framac-werror is hosted on GitHub. This the place to go to get help, and fill bug and feature reports (which you are welcome to do).

After having compiled and installed framac-werror (see the INSTALL file for that), executing
$frama-c -werror-help
should print-out the in-line help.
